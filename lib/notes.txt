Instructions

Your assignment: create a command line based application (similar to Secret Number) that fulfills the following criteria:

1. Takes user input and handles bad input appropriately (i.e. if you expect numbers and recieve a string)

2. Connects to a 3rd party API - the API call should change depending on the user input

3. Must be object oriented. Create classes and instantiate them. The only file that can run without classes is your runner.

4. Create a public repository and push your file code on Github. Please submit the link to your repository for this assignment.

This is a very open-ended assignment. Feel free to get creative! If there are any special features of your application that you would like to point out, please write about them in the README.

Idea: Ask the user to enter a baseball team and return players from that team



Creating an API Request
To make an API request, you’ll need to:
Have your developer key handy
Know the resource you're looking to retrieve
Know the format (i.e. JSON, XML) you want the response to be returned in
Here’s an example of an API request:
URI Format: HTTP GET http://api.espn.com/:version/:resource/:method?apikey=:yourkey

General URI Parameters Accepted
PARAMETER	DESCRIPTION	SAMPLE VALUE
apikey	String - developer key assigned to your account (Required)	yourkey
limit	Integer - used to limit the number of results returned	5
offset	Integer - used for pagination.	11 (will start with the 11th entry in the response)
_accept	String - used when you can not set the Accepted header. The most common case of this would be while making JSONP requests via JavaScript	text/xml
